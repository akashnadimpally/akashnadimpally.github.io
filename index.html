                <div class="description">The Game Day Analytics Challenge, created by Dr. Chong Oh at the David Eccles School of Business, University of Utah, is an annual competition that focuses on analyzing Twitter tweets related to Super Bowl ads. The challenge aims to extract valuable metrics regarding the performance, influence, and diffusion of these ads. Students participating in the competition gain practical knowledge in various areas of business analytics, including data collection, processing, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

                  The competition leverages technology such as PHP, MySQL, Python, MongoDB, Twitter API, Alteryx, and Domo to enable students to develop in-demand skills that prepare them for success in the job market. Teams participating in the challenge are required to present the best infographics and white papers that showcase the insights derived from their analysis of the Super Bowl ads.
