                As a Cloud Engineer, I developed an on-click POC that streamlined Infrastructure Deployment on Microsoft Azure and AWS, resulting in a remarkable 55% reduction in infrastructure setup time. I also took the lead in conducting disaster recovery drills and tests for Azure Infrastructure, ensuring system resilience and minimizing downtime by 25% during disruptions. Additionally, I implemented redundancy and failover strategies in AKS and MongoDB deployments, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance for uninterrupted business continuity. Furthermore, I developed automation scripts for Azure Network Infrastructure deployments and configurations, contributing to efficient and scalable operations.

As an SRE/Platform Engineer, I significantly reduced infrastructure provisioning time by 45% through the migration from on-premises to Azure and AWS Cloud platforms using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools such as Terraform and ARM Templates. I worked closely with clients and technology teams to facilitate seamless lift and shift migrations of applications to Azure and AWS, demonstrating my strong collaboration skills. By migrating applications from traditional infrastructure to a Kubernetes-based environment (AKS), I enhanced scalability and resource utilization. I also implemented robust monitoring and logging solutions like Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics, enabling comprehensive insights into AKS cluster health, performance, and troubleshooting.

In addition to that, I emphasized the importance of safe DevOps practices, ensuring compliance with control and security policies in the cloud environment before provisioning resources. Through my expertise, I identified and addressed performance bottlenecks, making changes that led to a substantial 25% reduction in resource utilization and improved system efficiency. These achievements demonstrate my ability to drive optimization, efficiency, and reliability in cloud-based environments.

                As a Cloud Engineer, I implemented monitoring frameworks with metrics that enhanced transparency, performance, scalability, and capacity validation through load testing. This resulted in a remarkable 30% increase in system efficiency by meeting all vital metrics and KPIs, making the systems healthy, secure, and reliable. Additionally, I streamlined data transfer by developing automation scripts using Python for ETL operations in Azure Data Factory, leading to increased efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, I excelled in optimizing cloud spending through thorough resource utilization analysis, identification of cost-saving opportunities, and strategic implementation.

As a DevOps Engineer, I made significant contributions to the development of Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines for building and releasing Java and .NET applications. I also applied deployment methodologies such as Blue-Green and Canary, ensuring seamless and efficient application deployments. Additionally, I played a key role in developing a Proof of Concept for Jenkins as a Service (JaaS) using open-source tools like Ansible and OpenStack. This initiative resulted in an impressive 42% reduction in build time and a 45% increase in team productivity. I further streamlined the deployment of microservices on cloud environments by utilizing containerization tools such as Docker and Kubernetes, resulting in a substantial 60% reduction in deployment time.

To ensure consistent and efficient deployment and configuration of infrastructure and applications, I implemented the configuration management tool Ansible. This automation improved deployment time and ensured consistency across various environments. I also automated Linux patching and email scheduling using Ansible playbooks, resulting in a significant 36% increase in efficiency. Additionally, I prepared comprehensive incident response documentation, including playbooks and runbooks, to guide team members in efficiently identifying, investigating, and resolving system issues. These initiatives demonstrate my ability to drive efficiency, automation, and effective incident management within a DevOps environment.

                <div class="description">The Game Day Analytics Challenge, created by Dr. Chong Oh at the David Eccles School of Business, University of Utah, is an annual competition that focuses on analyzing Twitter tweets related to Super Bowl ads. The challenge aims to extract valuable metrics regarding the performance, influence, and diffusion of these ads. Students participating in the competition gain practical knowledge in various areas of business analytics, including data collection, processing, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

                  The competition leverages technology such as PHP, MySQL, Python, MongoDB, Twitter API, Alteryx, and Domo to enable students to develop in-demand skills that prepare them for success in the job market. Teams participating in the challenge are required to present the best infographics and white papers that showcase the insights derived from their analysis of the Super Bowl ads.
                  
                  By analyzing social media platforms like Twitter, in addition to traditional mechanisms like the USA Today AD METER ratings, brands can monitor the performance of their Super Bowl ads more comprehensively. These digital footprints provide in-depth understanding of consumer feedback and reactions to the ads, allowing brands to gain valuable insights into their ad campaigns. </div>
                  
                  <div class="description">The Information Systems Game Day Analytics Challenge 2023 witnessed an exceptional achievement as our team secured the coveted 1st place. Through meticulous analysis of 2 million Super Bowl ad tweets, we utilized the power of the Twitter API to extract invaluable insights on ad sentiment and ROI, offering advertisers a deeper understanding of their campaign performance. Employing a diverse array of cutting-edge technologies including Python, Azure Cognitive Services, Alteryx, and Tableau, we delivered a comprehensive and visually captivating analysis that left a lasting impression. Our team's dedication, expertise, and unwavering commitment to excellence propelled us to this remarkable victory, solidifying our position as leaders in the field of business analytics. </div>

              Besides technical skills, I'm a great team player and communicator, always eager to collaborate to find innovative solutions that improve efficiency and productivity. I'm passionate about using technology to drive business success and expanding my knowledge by staying up-to-date with industry trends and technologies. Currently, I'm pursuing my master of science degree in Information systems at the University of Utah.
